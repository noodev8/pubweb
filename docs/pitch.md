# Pitch: Modern Pub Websites

## The Problem

Small pubs and restaurants are stuck with WordPress sites that:

- **Load slowly** - 3-4 second load times lose customers
- **Need the agency for everything** - Changing opening hours? That's £50 and a 3-day wait
- **Get out of date** - The friction means menus don't get updated, seasonal specials never get posted
- **Cost ongoing fees** - Monthly retainers for occasional text changes

The result: pub owners stop bothering. The website becomes stale. Customers call to check hours because they don't trust what's online.

## The Value Proposition

**"Your site, but faster—and you control your own menus and hours."**

We rebuild your website using modern technology:

- **Same look and feel** - Your regulars won't notice the difference
- **Dramatically faster** - Pages load instantly, not in 3-4 seconds
- **Self-service updates** - Change your menus, hours, and specials yourself. No waiting. No agency fees.
- **Always current** - Because updating is easy, your site stays accurate

## What You Can Update Yourself

| Content | How often pubs typically change it |
|---------|-----------------------------------|
| **Opening hours** | Seasonally, bank holidays, emergencies |
| **Food menus** | Weekly/monthly specials, price changes |
| **Drinks menus** | New guest ales, seasonal cocktails |
| **Special events** | Mother's Day, Christmas, quiz nights |
| **Gallery photos** | New dishes, events, seasonal decor |

All through a simple dashboard. No technical knowledge needed. Changes go live in seconds.

## Why Not Just Fix WordPress?

WordPress is a general-purpose tool trying to do everything. Your pub website needs to do a few things really well:

- Show who you are
- Display current menus and hours
- Let people find you and book

We build purpose-fit sites for hospitality. Faster, simpler, focused.

## The Pitch (30-second version)

> "How often do you update your website menu?
>
> Most pubs tell us they don't bother because it means calling the agency and waiting days for a simple change.
>
> We rebuild your site to look exactly the same—but load faster and let you update menus and hours yourself, whenever you want. No agency calls. No fees for text changes.
>
> Your site stays current because keeping it current is finally easy."

---

## What We're Not
